	        <p class="bios">Melanie is a Program Manager-turned-Dev during the week and an indecisive hiker on weekends. Tired of trying to find hikes on the WTA site only to discover they were too far away or too long for a day trip, she thought a “Find A Hike” app could help her and other PNW hikers discover new adventures that fit their energy and skill levels.</p>
